# Claims Handling Steps

This document outlines the standard steps for handling an insurance claim from initial notification through final resolution.

## Step 1: Claim Notification
A claim is initiated when a customer reports an incident through an approved channel such as phone, email, online portal, or mobile application. The case manager must verify the claimant’s identity before proceeding.

## Step 2: Claim Registration
The claim is registered in the claims management system with a unique claim reference number. All relevant details such as policy number, incident date, incident type, and claimant contact information are recorded.

## Step 3: Coverage Verification
The case manager verifies whether the reported incident is covered under the active policy. This includes checking policy validity, coverage limits, exclusions, and waiting periods.

## Step 4: Evidence Collection
Supporting documents are collected, which may include photographs, repair quotes, medical reports, police reports, or witness statements. Missing or incomplete documentation must be followed up promptly.

## Step 5: Claim Assessment
The claim is assessed by evaluating liability, damages, and compliance with policy terms. Complex claims may be escalated to senior assessors or subject matter experts.

## Step 6: Decision Making
Based on the assessment, the claim is either approved, partially approved, or denied. The decision and reasoning must be clearly documented in the system.

## Step 7: Settlement and Communication
If approved, settlement is processed according to policy terms. The claimant is informed of the outcome, settlement amount, and payment timeline through official communication channels.

## Step 8: Claim Closure
Once payment is completed or the claim is denied and communicated, the claim is formally closed. All records must be retained in accordance with regulatory and retention policies.
