# Privacy and PII Handling Guidelines

This document outlines how personally identifiable information (PII) must be handled during claims processing and system interactions.

## Definition of PII
PII includes any information that can identify an individual, such as full name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address, policy number, and bank account details.

## Data Collection
Only information that is necessary for claim processing should be collected. Excessive or unrelated personal data must not be requested or stored.

## Data Access Controls
Access to PII must be restricted based on role and responsibility. Case managers may only access information required to perform their duties.

## Data Storage
PII must be stored securely using approved systems and encryption standards. Storing sensitive information in unsecured files or personal devices is strictly prohibited.

## Data Sharing
PII must not be shared with third parties unless required for claim assessment or mandated by law. Any sharing must follow approved data-sharing agreements.

## Data Retention
Personal data must be retained only for the duration required by regulatory and business needs. After this period, data must be securely deleted or anonymised.

## Incident Management
Any suspected data breach or unauthorised access to PII must be reported immediately through the designated incident response process.
